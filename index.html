        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>In today's society, gaming has become arguably the biggest new entertainment medium in the last decade and is without a doubt the most immersive. With a new era of gaming approaching us with the Xbox One and Playstation 4, I figured now would probably be the absolute best time to launch this website. With all the largest gaming websites being notorious by selling their advertising space and high scores to whoever pays out the most money, I think it is always important to have an independent voice, speaking out about which games are good, bad, underrated or overrated and underappreciated. This website will also serve as a nostalgic reminder for all people who are interested. I will include modern reviews as well as retro reviews and some fun top five or ten lists recapping the best, worst or most nostalgic of TV shows, videogames or movies. I love gaming and I want to be the neutral voice that everyone will hear. Nothing but the honest truth about the games I review, be it retro or recent. Hope you all enjoy.</p>
        
        <h2>Interview with Ph.D student Anthony Palomba</h2>
        
        <p>Anthony Palomba is a gradutae from Syracuse University and teaches TV and American Society (RTV 3405) at the University of Florida. The following interview took place on November 21st, 2013 in his office on the Weimer Hall.</p>
        
        <h5>Q:Where do you think gaming will be in the next 5-10 years due to all of the technological advancements we have made? What would be the next step?</h5>
        
        <p>A: The NES stood for Nintendo Entertainment System… now the NES was a lot of things but it was not an entertainment system. It wasn’t all-inclusive. We’re marching towards consolidation and media conglomeration and we’ve seen this before. We keep seeing these companies being bought up. So I think you are going to see more and more consolidation and I think you’re going to see some struggle if Nintendo or Microsoft goes with other film companies cause it’s a struggle of a brand image, the parent brand. I’ll also say that I believe people are going to be marching towards these consoles more, I mean if you’re on Xbox and you can watch film, TV, listen to radio, take care of your Skype, we’re getting towards this point where it’s pretty much all conversion. The other thing I think will happen, we’re seeing this with Minecraft, there are so many developers in college right now, Minecraft came out to allow anybody to create a videogame. If we get to that point, people may very well be creating their own videogames and it might be interesting to see if the Wii allowed for that, if you create a video game with the Nintendo Wii’s controllers and it’s on their software and it’s online they may claim they have IP ownership on it. We’re seeing more people creating their own entertainment. Eventually, it might happen with a sophisticated medium like videogames. </p>
        
        <h5>Q: Do you believe triple A blockbusters like Call of Duty or Halo, are hurting and ruining the gaming industry?</h5>
        
        <p>This is why I love video games, because the same issue has been in movies and has been in movies since the last 25 years since Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Willis all came out, everybody’s been screaming from the hilltops; ‘Where’s the art films?” All we’re seeing is explosions for Christ’s sake. Will it hurt gaming? It segments the audience. Does it hurt the industry? That’s a tough question, for sure it fractures the industry because people have different focuses. Call of Duty could be earning the most revenue in the gaming industry, but could that hurt other games in the industry? Yeah, sure. You might lose audiences, and you might not be able to create as many games because of these big blockbusters you’re competing with, cause those people will be asking, ‘Where are the artsy journey games?’ that go far beyond explosions and M-16’s? It’s tough though because at the same time Call of Duty pushes the boundaries for graphics and realism and it sets a very high bar and in a capitalist system that’s what you want. You want people fighting to get the best damn videogame you can. When you raise the bar, everyone wants to gravitate to the bar. I see pros and cons to both. Call of Duty pushes the bounds of multiplayer gaming and realism, and when you say ‘hurt’ whom does it hurt? Audiences love it. If people love it, I don’t think it hurts the industry.</p>
        
        <h5>Q: What are some of the best aspects of gaming?</h5>
        
        <p>A: Hand-eye coordination and dexterity for one thing. There have been studies that surgeons, who operate on our bodies, that their hand-eye coordination and dexterity are sharper. Videogames have been shown to stimulate minds and logic as well, so people can practice their logic and critical thinking. Even back when I was 5 years old playing Zelda, trying to figure out what cave to go in, when you get past the graphics, videogames do teach a level of logic and I think that often times that is bypassed and people overlook it. Videogames have also impressed upon us the idea of mulligans. You can die and try again. Oh, Mario fell off the cliff? It’s okay you have an extra life, try again, and give it another shot. The idea I can formulate a skill set and bring it to a videogame brings a sense of pride to the player, and they can feel prideful of when it happens. Inevitably, videogames will take you anywhere you want to be. You can’t afford to go on vacation somewhere? Buy a videogame. It’s so realistic in some respects that you are able to interact with different worlds and time periods that you wouldn’t have access to.</p>
        
        <h5>Q: How about the negative aspects?</h5>
        
        <p>A: It’s like anything else. If you’re shooting zombies all day, and you’re not reading Aristotle, then your mind is suffering in other ways. You might be savvy as a critical thinker, but you might not be a good reader. How long would it take you to feel the same sense in pride from reading a book, when compared to how long it would take you to shoot down 20 people in Grand Theft Auto? This would take hours, and who knows if you even like the damn thing. I think that videogames also teach us instant gratification, and that can erode at our abilities to partake in activities that take a long time. You also might interact less with humans, you might go out less. Gaming is a fantastic forum of entertainment, but too much of it could hurt someone, in a social aspect.</p>
        
        
        <h5>Q: Videogames have gathered a lot of notoriety from political figures and parents. Often, videogames are blamed for tragedies such as Columbine. If you were put on the spot, on a political forum, what would you tell or show them your perspective?</h5>
        
        <p>A: One study in fact shows that when videogames were introduced into the public, I believe it was from ’85 to ’95 or 2000, crime decreased.  Some studies show that videogames can actually be used to deter violence because it can be a cathartic element. Videogames in the wrong hands can be a lot of different things. If someone chooses to shoot a cop in Grand Theft Auto, that’s their own prerogative, ultimately, we have many things in society that people would frown upon and that would be one, but we also have to consider our 1st amendment rights. We gravitate to violence for quite some time. It’s in our radio, TV and movies. I would simply ask them to shy me research that shows me definitively that videogames cause violence. It might influence it, but influence and cause are two video different things and very difficult to prove. </p>
        
        <h5>Q: What do you believe is one of the most important developments in the history of gaming? Online gaming? What would you say?</h5>
        
        <p>A: Two things come to mind. First off, the CD-ROM. Just being able to get graphics and the ability to have more memory and space to make the gameplay more fluid and the other to me is the Nintendo Wii. The ability to move from your couch and interact with the videogame is just tremendous. It was also I video game arcades in the 90’s, but now it’s being brought into the living room. The level of interactivity for the Wii is very very different as opposed to just holding a controller. It’s a different experience. We are being taught: This is how you play a video game. You get up, you move, you experience. What is in the living room? Couches, cushions, pillows… Those aren’t meant for activities, this is a very new behavior we are teaching people in their living rooms. </p>
        
        <h5>Q: Do you think Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will ever pool their resources to make a console together? Or share some of their exclusive licenses?</h5>
        
        <p>A: They will band together if more videogame competition enters the marketplace. We see this with the Ouya and Steam Box, but these are obviously in the beginning stages. I believe for these exclusive licenses to be crossed over to a different console, one of the big three would have to fold, like Sega. </p>
        
        <h5>Q: Last question. Most gamers fantasize of seeing their favorite videogame on the big screen. Why do you believe so many of these movies are terrible, when the games, which are very cinematic, can be so fantastic?</h5>
        
        <p>A: Film companies have a particular way of telling a story that I don’t believe videogames believe in. You have people who see popular videogames, but don’t see why they are popular, so they might try to make it more relatable to the general population, with a fantastic writer. But are these writers playing the games? Are you sitting down and playing it? I question that. I also question their research and how they research and cast characters. Videogames are also very similar to comic books. If you get it wrong, people will get pissed. They know it. If you screw up, they will know and you will hear about it. They keep trying to pitch it for smaller audiences and they keep tweaking it and deluding it. Videogames were meant for a small audience. How do you make it adult and child like? Hollywood struggles with it. I don’t think they are doing their research and I think the people running Hollywood have been set in their ways for a long time.  </p>
