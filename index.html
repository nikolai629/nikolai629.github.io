        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>In today's society, gaming has become arguably the biggest new entertainment medium in the last decade and is without a doubt the most immersive. With a new era of gaming approaching us with the Xbox One and Playstation 4, I figured now would probably be the absolute best time to launch this website. With all the largest gaming websites being notorious by selling their advertising space and high scores to whoever pays out the most money, I think it is always important to have an independent voice, speaking out about which games are good, bad, underrated or overrated and underappreciated. This website will also serve as a nostalgic reminder for all people who are interested. I will include modern reviews as well as retro reviews and some fun top five or ten lists recapping the best, worst or most nostalgic of TV shows, videogames or movies. I love gaming and I want to be the neutral voice that everyone will hear. Nothing but the honest truth about the games I review, be it retro or recent. Hope you all enjoy.</p>
