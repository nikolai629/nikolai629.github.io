        <p>Born in 1993, I believe that I grew up in the absolute best time frame imaginable. Cartoons on TV were funny, colorful and violent. The blessing and curse of online console gaming was unheard of, and the worries of growing up and being an adult seemed so far away. While I do indeed love all of this fantastic technology that didn't exist back when I was a child, such as iPhones or Netflix, I do miss the old days where friends would meet up at each others houses for a junk-food, sugar-rushed, pizza-filled day of mayhem where everyone would be huddled around their respective TV sets playing Halo in a mad rush to prove one's dominance over the competition. Those days are gone, but I remember them as the best. Nothing beats sniping your best buddy from across the map then when he turns to look at you, you taunt him in celebration. </p>

<p>I made this website for a school project, but I am also planning to do this for fun. I plan to look back on classic games, movies and TV shows and give my honest opinion of whether or not they still hold up and are still as memorable and great as they were all those years ago, and also offer some basic tips to bring the nostaligic feeling back to the people by instructing them of classic movies, shows and videogames they should play. I will also be reviewing more recent videogame and movie releases. </p>

<p>If you want me to review anything ranging from a videogames, TV shows, movies or anything you love and hold dear to your heart, or you simply just want to chat about the "good ol' days", all you have to do is shoot me a message. Send me an email or contact me via Twitter, Xbox Live (Gamertag: Nizoki) or PSN (PSN ID: Nizoki or HeyItsNikolai).
