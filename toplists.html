        <h2>Niko's Top 5 Nostalgic Cartoons</h2>
         
        
        <h3>HONORABLE MENTION: Invader Zim</h3>
        <p><img src="img/zim.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="Zim" title="Zim with his minion, Gir. Photo Credit: Broadcaster Jeff of gamentrain.com"/></p>
        <p>This show has a pretty large cult following for a show that had a relatively short lifespan (two seasons, 27 episodes in total) but it is well worth all the praise and admiration it received. A funny show with great characters and hysterical dialogue as well as absurd plot points and settings that you couldn't help but shake your head and laugh at. A humorously dark atmosphere and plot, this show was a prime example of a show that ended far too soon.</p>
        
        <h3>#5: Rocko's Modern Life</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/rocko.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Rocko" title="Rocko is a braincase. Photo Credit: This One Person of degrassi.wikia.com"/></p>
        <p>A pretty controversial show throughout its runtime, Rocko's Modern Life was a show that was made for kids, but with a heavy dose of adult humor for the parents also watching. One never knew the outlandish approach that this show would take to the everyday issues of everyone's favorite wallaby, but it always did it with humor that everyone enjoyed. The kids got the slapstick approach, and the adults got the subtle undertones. A great show that many fondly look back on and enjoy.</p>
        
        <h3>#4: Ed Edd n' Eddy</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/ed.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="EEE" title="Ed Edd n' Eddy planning their misdeeds. Photo Credit: Samuel Bolton of ed.wikia.com"/></p>
        <p>A show that centered around three best friends always trying to scam the fellow children of their neighborhoods out of their allowance doesnâ€™t really seem like a great sell at first but it really is something you have to watch. The three main leads; Ed, Edd and Eddy, were all over-the-top charming characters with their own flaws that made them seem real and enjoyable to watch on screen. While most shows have one or two main characters, this show dealt with a trifecta of characters that were completely opposite, and possibly annoying in some instances alone, but when combined together, blending perfectly into an amazing mix. The strongest thing that Ed Edd n' Eddy had over other TV shows was it's sustainability of quality.  While other shows may start off strong and then go through spikes in quality, Ed Edd n' Eddy stayed funny and enjoyable throughout. The first season was as good as the last season and I still remember the final movie as one of my favorite endings to any series.</p>
        
        <h3>#3: Pokemon</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/poke.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="Pokemon" title="Bulbasaur, Pikachu, Squirtle and Charmander. Photo Credit: Quantum Art of deviantart.com"/></p>
        <p>Not so much just the TV show, but much more about the entire Pokemon movement and franchise that dominated the United States, Japan and Europe in the 1990s.  Everybody in the world had Pokemon cards, movies and if you had a Gameboy, it was practically an unwritten law that you either had Pokemon Blue or Red. Bright and vibrant, creative and fun, this show had kids glued to whichever screen was currently playing Pokemon. While some people, mainly religious zealots, criticized the show, the entire series and franchise was fantastic and it's impact on the youth of the 90's cannot possibly be overstated.</p>
        
        <h3>#2: Rugrats</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/RUGRATS_Logo1.png" width="400" height="300" alt="rugrats" title="Rugrats title. Photo Credit: rugrats.wikia.com"/></p>
        <p>While most shows here had some sort of controversy, this show had none. Critically acclaimed by all who watched, this show that was blossoming with creativity and interesting characters that every kid could relate to. While this was all important to the success and acclaim it received, in my eyes what set this show apart from every other show, were the topics that this show tackled. The loss of a loved one, learning to accept those for who they are and not who they look like, the problems of growing up, sibling rivalries, this show related to every kid and always promoted positive ideals. </p>
        
        <h3>#1: Dragon Ball Z</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/gokuvegeta.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="DBZ" title="Goku and Vegeta's rivalry extends throughout the entire series as one of the greatest in all of storytelling. Photo Credit: HDwallfan.com"/></p>
        <p>One of the greatest TV show ever made, regardless of era or genre, DBZ was something that every kid loved. Interesting characters, who ended the series as a completely different person than which they started from (true character development), cliffhangers that left us on the edge of our seat, giddy with anticipation, waiting for the next episode, and break-neck, fast-paced action that got our blood pumping and hearts racing. Granted while there were many filler, some episodes that could have been entirely skipped or ignored, it gave the impression of a true living, breathing universe that felt very real. Love and hated, jealousy and despair, sacrifice and mourning, all these emotions were displayed and presented in a mature way that we all connected with that kept us attached to all the characters for all 291 episodes. The greatest nostalgic TV show anyone could hope for, Dragon Ball Z is well worth of the #1 spot on this list, and nearly every other list imaginable. </p>
        
        <h2>Niko's Top 5 Game Modes in Multiplayer</h2>
        
        <h3>#5: Infection in Halo 2</h3>
        
        <img src="img/345976.png" width="450" height="300" alt="infect" title="Shotguns vs. Energy Swords, that is essentially what infection is. Loads of fun. Photo Credit: David Lynch of nowgamer.com"/>
        
        <p>Back against the wall, bodies pilling up in the hallway, the Halo announcer shouts out "Killing Frenzy" as the last body hits the ground. You're the last man alive, and you are desperately loading your shotgun while you see another wave of infected rushing you, energy sword in hand and soon they'll be within lunging range. A very fun party game mode, infected is easy to understand, has a fast pace and is just very fun all the way around.</p>
        
        <h3>#4: Cops n' Crooks in GTA IV</h3>
        
        <img src="img/gta4.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="gta4" title="Many of the rounds end with the police and crooks taking cover behind cars and having a classic shootout in the street while the Boss makes a break for the getaway vehicle. Photo Credit: GTA4.net"/>
        
        <p>The classic "good guys vs. bad guys" ideal game mode, Cops n' Crooks is an exciting game mode where you race to an escape vehicle (boat or helicopter) while you hear sirens wailing behind you as the police try and shoot out your tires. Now you are on foot, the helicopter is within sight. Your teammate just fired an RPG and blew up the cop car that was hot on your tail, but one last cop guns him down and is right on you. You climb into the helicopter and the blades start spinning, as you see him raise his AK-47 and the muzzle flash, your health starts dropping and you pull back, desperately trying to get airborne. Do you? Play the game mode to find out.  </p>
        
        <h3>#3: Search and Destroy in Call of Duty 4</h3>
        
        <img src="img/maxresdefault.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="cod4" title="Very seldom in gaming does the tension get as high as it does when you are the last man standing. Photo Credit: Prodigy Joey of Youtube.com"/>
        
        <p>Score tied 3-3, five teammates down, last man standing, six enemies remaining, three seconds left until the bomb is planted and you hear the footsteps around the corner. Search and Destroy can be possibly one of the most exciting game modes imaginable when playing with a group of friends. Everything about it just screams excitement. One life, a strict time limit and 100% of your attention is needed to survive. I picked COD 4 specifically because this is when the COD series was still enjoyable and this personally holds a special place in my heart because my friends and I would play this all the time back in 2007. </p>
        
        <h3>#2: Free for all in Super Smash Brothers</h3>
        
        <img src="img/ssb.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="ssb ffa" title="Pick your favorite character, and have at it with three friends. Photo Credit: Seth Schiesel of The New York Times"/>
        
        <p>Complete pandemonium and chaos is what will ensue when you play SSB. Doesn't matter if it's SSB: Melee or SSB: Brawl, both games are a blast to play and when you have four players of equal skill, duking it out on a flat surface (Final Destination is the best map by far), it is insane. There are no allies, and constant movement is necessary. It becomes a mad rush for any power-ups, particularly the Pokeballs and whoever pulls off the victory will take bragging rights of superiority. These FFA games aren't even so much about skill, but more about smarts and the ability to survive. Positioning yourself is key. Knowing when to save your double jump, and when to team up for a brief moment to eliminate an opponent on the fringe, these are all things you need to know to win and it is just fantastic.</p>
        
        <h3>#1: Capture the Flag in Halo 2</h3>
        
        <img src="img/halo2.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="halo2" title="In about 2 seconds, this guy is going to be the most hunted player in the world. Photo Credit: Rob Semsey of teamxbox.com"/>
        
        <p>The ultimate teamwork game, Halo 2's Capture the Flag, particularly on the map, Coagulation is just a mad rush of action and speed. More than any other game mode, this is a game mode where you NEED to work as a team. You need some people to defend the flag, you need some to crash up the middle and try and steal the opposition's flag and you need that one guy who will creep up the base and try to sneak out the back door, flag in hand. Seldom was there as much excitement when you were the one with the flag, your warthog just blew up, you look over your shoulder and see tanks, ghosts and countless soldiers running at you and throwing grenades, while you see your teammate in the horizon racing to you as fast as they can before it's too late. A fantastic game mode, personally in my opinion the single best there is.</p>
        
        <h2>Niko's Top 10 Games of the 6th Console Generation</h2>
        
        <h3>#10: ESPN 2k5</h3>
        
        <img src="img/ps2_nfl_2k5_03.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="2k" title="Michael Vick was always electrifiying regardless of what football game you play. Photo Credit: PSXextreme.com"/>
        
        <p>This is in my opinion the best sports videogame of all-time, regardless of sport or console generation. The presentation with ESPN made this game completely unmatchable as far as how fantastic it looked and how great it was shown to us. The game was amazing to play and it really is a shame that EA bought the exclusive rights to make NFL games because 2K's last game was by far the best sports game that was ever made.</p>
        
        <h3>#9: Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</h3>
        
        <img src="img/splinter_cell-chaos_theory2.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="psy" title="It seems to be a running theme that soliders in videogames don't know how to turn around when they hear a noise. Photo Credit: Trenten Chalmers of theparanoidgamer.com"/>
        
        <p>What puts this game up this high on the list was the co-op. Without a doubt one of my favorite co-op experiences with my friend Skylar, we played for hours on end and at times we would challenge ourselves. We would at times run through the level, guns blazing and skulls popping, and other times we would try and be ghosts, crawling through the shadows, hanging from the rafters and silently dispatching of foes. A very fun game, and a great game to play if you want to play side-by-side with a friend. </p>

        
       <h3>#8: Star Wars Battlefront</h3>
        
        <img src="img/swb.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="psy" title="Battles on the ground and in space, choose the Empire or the Rebellion. Photo Credit: Gamewallpapers.com hosted by JTLnet.com"/>
        
        <p>This is the game that I am on my hands and knees begging for with PS4 and Xbox One released. Everyone loves Star Wars and when you played Star Wars: Battlefront against your friends, absolutely nothing rivaled it. SW: BF 2 was also a decent game, but the first one was a game that laid the groundwork down and showed a glimmer of the potential of true ultimate all-out warfare in the Star Wars franchise. If you like Star Wars, this is a must own.</p>

        
        <h3>#7: Psychonauts</h3>
        
        <img src="img/psy.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="psy" title="All of the characters in this game have distinct personality traits, faults and abilities that make them all endearing to the player Photo Credit: Robert Hunter of rshunter-author.com"/>
        
        <p>The most creative game I have ever played is also one of the funniest and interesting games. Interesting characters, creative environments, an unpredictable but interesting and humorous storyline, Psychonauts was one of those games that nobody ever really bought, but everyone absolutely loved when they played it. If you want to play something different, something unique, check this game out because I can honest say there is no experience quite like this.</p>
        
        <h3>#6: Max Payne</h3>
        
        <img src="img/max.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="2k" title="Max Payne is one of the most interesting videogame characters ever...despite looking constipated. Photo Credit: Brad Nicholson of Destructoid"/>
        
        <p>The first 6th console game that I personally owned, Max Payne was a dark, gritty violent game that focused on a jaded cop who was suffering into a downward spiral induced by painkillers and alcohol after the murder of his wife and child. Max Payne was one of the first games to introduce bullet-time and tie it directly into it's gameplay, and the shooting and action is still tight, exciting and a real joy to pull off. All three Max Payne games are fantastic and I highly recommend buying the Max Payne trilogy because they are all great games with amazing action and one of the best protagonists that I can remember in any game series.</p>

      <h3>#5: Sly Cooper (PS2 trilogy)</h3>
        
        <img src="img/sly.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="psy" title="All three Sly Cooper games are fantastic and can be bought for dirt cheap. Photo Credit: Earnest Cavalli of digitaltrends.com"/>
        
        <p>I may be cheated by picking three games, but hey, it's my website. Sly Cooper is one of the most underrated game series of all-time every Sly Cooper holds a special place in my heart. A great cast of interesting characters, distinct art style and a protagonist that you couldnâ€™t help but root for. Each game added something new to the formula and always had interesting characters and bosses that you would go toe-to-toe with. An interesting storyline that would tie into future games, Sly Cooper is a game series that I truly wish got more recognition for how good it truly was. Let us hope that another Sly Cooper game will grace us on the PS4. </p>

        
        <h3>#4: Metal Gear Solid: Subsistence</h3>
        
        <img src="img/mgs.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="psy" title="The final shot of Snake slauting during the final credits is one of the most powerful scenes I've seen and the perfect ending to an amazing game. Photo Credit: David Garcia of stevendavidmichaelgarcia.blogspot.com"/>
        
        <p>Personally, I loathed the Metal Gear Solid series when I was younger. I always saw these freakish high scores from critics and gamers and never understood why. I played both MGS 1 and MGS 2 and I thought the games were boring and poorly designed, so I labeled the entire series as overrated... then I played Metal Gear Solid: Subsistence and I was blown away by everything. The biggest thing that I appreciated was the change of the camera into a third-person perspective. In addition to the great camera, graphics and gameplay, the story and characters were absolutely amazing. This game had personally, my favorite ending of any game in history and the most interesting cast of bosses that I've ever seen. A great game, regardless of what games you love, buy this one.</p>
        
        <h3>#3: Super Smash Brothers Melee</h3>
        
        <img src="img/ssb.png" width="250" height="300" alt="psy" title="North American box art. Photo Credit: Dakota Lasky of nintendoenthusiast.com"/>
        
        <p>SSBM is a great party game and many of my weekends were spent at friend's houses drinking endless amounts of sugar-enlaced sodas and eating pizza while playing these two games. SSBM was a novelty game but nobody can ignore the charm of watching Link, Donkey Kong, Mario and Star Fox duking it out in outer space. Great game. </p>
        
        <h3>#2: Halo 2</h3>
        
        <img src="img/1113851031.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="psy" title="Total warfare... All for a piece of fabric attached to a stick. Photo Credit: Brent Soboleski of teamxbox.com"/>
        
        <p>This is the ultimate party game and everyone I have ever met who calls themselves a gamer remembers the memorable weekends at friends houses on the weekend back in the early to mid 2000's. This was probably the best gaming experience I ever had, playing Halo against your friends was an event. Everyone would bring their Xbox, their TV and copy of Halo. You would have 10 TV's in one household, all linked up, and would play for hours on end. Free-for-all, team deathmatch, capture the flag, you played every game mode, every map and everyone had their own strategies and play styles. Halo 2 also added in the element of truly customizing your own Spartan, so everyone had their own distinctive emblem and color scheme so when the hot pink Spartan with the Cowboy Kitty emblem cracked your skull open with a shotgun, you knew exactly who it was... Damn you, Travis.</p>
        
        <h3>#1: Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</h3>
        
        <img src="img/sa.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="psy" title="The legacy and memories this game leaves behind to everyone who has played it is too much for words. Photo Credit: SFdude of fanpop.com"/>
        
        <p>Quite possibly the greatest game of all-time, what more can I say about it? The only thing I can say is just go out and buy this game right now. You won't regret it.</p>
        
        <h2>Niko's Top 5 Underrated Games of the 7th Console Generation (Video):</h2>
        
        <h5><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/S6jXKzPah0o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></h5>

        <p>Every now and then certain games are released and for whatever reason they are pushed by the wayside and left unrecognized by gamers and critics alike. It could have been a poor release date, a lack of advertisement, a bad first review or just a lack of interest that could have crippled the games chances to be recognized as an all-time classic, but that doesn't mean that these games are to be forgotten. Watch the video above to see what I personally believe are the top five most underrated games of the seventh console generation.</p>
