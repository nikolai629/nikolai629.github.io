        <h2>Niko's Top 5 Nostalgic Cartoons</h2>
         
        
        <h3>HONORABLE MENTION: Invader Zim</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/zim.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="Zim" title="Zim with his minion: Gir"/></p>
        <p>This show has a pretty large cult following for a show that had a relatively short lifespan (two seasons, 27 episodes in total) but it is well worth all the praise and admiration it received. A funny show with great characters and hysterical dialogue as well as absurd plot points and settings that you couldn't help but shake your head and laugh at. A humorously dark atmosphere and plot, this show was a prime example of a show that ended far too soon.</p>
        
        <h3>#5: Rocko's Modern Life</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/rocko.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Rocko" title="Rocko is a braincase"/></p>
        <p>A pretty controversial show throughout its runtime, Rocko's Modern Life was a show that was made for kids, but with a heavy dose of adult humor for the parents also watching. One never knew the outlandish approach that this show would take to the everyday issues of everyone's favorite wallaby, but it always did it with humor that everyone enjoyed. The kids got the slapstick approach, and the adults got the subtle undertones. A great show that many fondly look back on and enjoy.</p>
        
        <h3>#4: Ed Edd n' Eddy</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/ed.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="EEE" title="Ed Edd n' Eddy planning their misdeeds"/></p>
        <p>A show that centered around three best friends always trying to scam the fellow children of their neighborhoods out of their allowance doesnâ€™t really seem like a great sell at first but it really is something you have to watch. The three main leads; Ed, Edd and Eddy, were all over-the-top charming characters with their own flaws that made them seem real and enjoyable to watch on screen. While most shows have one or two main characters, this show dealt with a trifecta of characters that were completely opposite, and possibly annoying in some instances alone, but when combined together, blending perfectly into an amazing mix. The strongest thing that Ed Edd n' Eddy had over other TV shows was it's sustainability of quality.  While other shows may start off strong and then go through spikes in quality, Ed Edd n' Eddy stayed funny and enjoyable throughout. The first season was as good as the last season and I still remember the final movie as one of my favorite endings to any series.</p>
        
        <h3>#3 Pokemon</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/poke.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="Pokemon" title="Bulbasaur, Pikachu, Squirtle and Charmander"/></p>
        <p>Not so much just the TV show, but much more about the entire Pokemon movement and franchise that dominated the United States, Japan and Europe in the 1990s.  Everybody in the world had Pokemon cards, movies and if you had a Gameboy, it was practically an unwritten law that you either had Pokemon Blue or Red. Bright and vibrant, creative and fun, this show had kids glued to whichever screen was currently playing Pokemon. While some people, mainly religious zealots, criticized the show, the entire series and franchise was fantastic and it's impact on the youth of the 90's cannot possibly be overstated.</p>
        
        <h3>#2 Rugrats</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/RUGRATS_Logo1.png" width="400" height="300" alt="rugrats" title="Rugrats title"/></p>
        <p>While most shows here had some sort of controversy, this show had none. Critically acclaimed by all who watched, this show that was blossoming with creativity and interesting characters that every kid could relate to. While this was all important to the success and acclaim it received, in my eyes what set this show apart from every other show, were the topics that this show tackled. The loss of a loved one, learning to accept those for who they are and not who they look like, the problems of growing up, sibling rivalries, this show related to every kid and always promoted positive ideals. </p>
        
        <h3>#1 Dragon Ball Z</h3>
        <p><p><img src="img/gokuvegeta.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="DBZ" title="Goku and Vegeta's rivalry extends throughout the entire series as one of the greatest in all of storytelling"/></p>
        <p>One of the greatest TV show ever made, regardless of era or genre, DBZ was something that every kid loved. Interesting characters, who ended the series as a completely different person than which they started from (true character development), cliffhangers that left us on the edge of our seat, giddy with anticipation, waiting for the next episode, and break-neck, fast-paced action that got our blood pumping and hearts racing. Granted while there were many filler, some episodes that could have been entirely skipped or ignored, it gave the impression of a true living, breathing universe that felt very real. Love and hated, jealousy and despair, sacrifice and mourning, all these emotions were displayed and presented in a mature way that we all connected with that kept us attached to all the characters for all 291 episodes. The greatest nostalgic TV show anyone could hope for, Dragon Ball Z is well worth of the #1 spot on this list, and nearly every other list imaginable. </p>
