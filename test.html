        <h2>Retro Review: DOOM</h2>
        
        <p>Created in 1993 by John Carmack, Tom Hall and iD software, DOOM put players into the boots of a lone space-marine simply named “Doom Guy” as he fought back the demonic hordes from Hell equipped with a diverse range of weaponry. DOOM is fondly remembered as one of the best games of all-time and one of the most important games in history due to the gameplay innovations it brought us, the controversy it garnered and the entertainment it gave us. Taking off our “nostalgic glasses” for a moment, let us step back an analyze this game and be honest with ourselves. Does DOOM hold up? Or is it a casualty of a bygone age?</p>    
        
        <h3>GAMEPLAY:</h3>
        
        <p>DOOM is indeed, the first videogame I ever played in my life. I was around 3 years old when I first started playing this game and I played it off-and-on throughout the years before I finally sat down and played the entire game recently for this Retro Review. What was one of the first things I realized about this game when I played on the “Nightmare” difficulty? The intensity. Seldom times in gaming are as remotely intense as playing DOOM on the hardest difficulty, running from demons, with 5% health, four shotgun shells left and only three monsters standing between you and the exit. This game had me on the edge of my seat, leaning side to side when I was trying to dodge fireballs or rockets, standing up and jumping around when I was running away, desperately seeking a first-aid kit. This level of intensity is practically non-existent in most games nowadays, but the intensity present here is about 90% of the fun and there is absolutely no way you can play this game without your heart pounding and body muscles tensing up. The difficulty in this game is as high as the player wants it to be. The aforementioned “nightmare” difficulty is exactly as it is described, a nightmare. Low ammo, low health and seemingly invincible monsters, you are forced to strategize the best routes and ideas to stay alive. The shooting, which is the core of the game, is fast and frenetic as I previously said. Shooting down the hordes is fun, running for your life is tense, and searching for the secret areas that are present in every level is a nice addition too. Something that intrigues me about DOOM and early 90’s shooters like Duke Nukem is how big the levels are. Sprawling, non-linear levels with secrets, easter eggs and fantastic artistic touches, it’s such a juxtaposition from games like Call of Duty nowadays where you are practically dragged through a narrow hallway on a choke chain, limited by cutscenes and invisible walls. The old days of gaming didn’t have this, and it is massively appreciated. The gameplay holds up as well as it ever did.</p>
        
        <h3>SOUND:</h3>
        
        <p>Usually an underrated element in every game, the music in DOOM is as ageless as possible. The somber tones when you’re in the depths of Hell low on health, wondering if another demon is standing on the other side of the door you’re about to open, the hardcore metal blasting when you’re running through corridors mowing down the undead with the brand new shotgun you just picked up, the music perfectly accents the feelings and emotions of the player. In addition to the music, the sound effects are top notch. The roars and growls of the monsters echoing through the level makes you tense, the sound of Doom Guy screaming out in pain once your health hit’s 0%, the power behind your shotgun, plasma rifle, machine gun or rocket launcher, it all sounds top notch. Sound effects are hard to describe but just do yourself a favor and watch some DOOM gameplay on YouTube. Even the simplest sound effects as opening doors, picking up armor or scrolling through the menu are absolutely perfect. The audio in this game is as timeless and perfect as we remember and upon reflection, DOOM’s soundtrack has to be one of the best in any game of all-time.</p>
        
        <h3>GRAPHICS:</h3>
        
        <p>Graphics are a hard thing to talk about in retrospect. You obviously can’t compare DOOM to Half-Life 2 in the sense of graphics. Hardware and technical limitations are obvious, so you have to think about how it looked at the time. Obviously the graphics look dated now, because the game came out in 1993, but don’t think that means they look bad. Games today are focused around 3 colors: brown, black and grey. The color palate for games nowadays is dark, dreary and dull for the most part, but back then and including DOOM, the colors are bright, vibrant and at the same time dreary and scary. The demons all look scary, the levels set the perfect tones (corpses hanging from the ceiling, heads on pikes) the graphics make you feel nervous, unsettled and scared, which is very impressive that a game with graphics this simple could instill such emotion from the player. The graphics still look great despite being over 20 years old.</p>
        
        <h3>VERDICT:</h3>
        
        <p>DOOM is one of the greatest games of the 1990s and in the entire history of gaming in general and it undoubtedly holds up. I actually love and appreciate this game even more now as a 20 year old adult, rather than I did as a kid. It’s a relic from a past age and no matter how many years pass, DOOM will always be as fantastic and perfect as it was when it first released back in 1993. 10/10 back then, 10/10 today. Go out and buy DOOM, on your computer, iPhone, Xbox, whatever. Play it  to help remind yourself that despite all of the carbon-copy Call Of Duty games that nearly every game will try to copy off of, gaming is still worth defending and playing because of games like DOOM. </p>
